A clean, super minimal responsive template geared towards startups, app devs, and other
dedicated folks working tirelessly to launch their products. Includes a landing page,
generic page, contact page, and a page with a whole mess of pre-styled elements (something
new I'm trying out). Sass sources are also included.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

(* = Not included)

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
